# ShowMeFileSizes

I wasn't entirely satisfied with the way that command line tools like ls and du display the output for file sizes and I wanted to learn more C.

This program is an attempt to kill two birds with the one stone.


### Compile
```bash
gcc filesize.c -o filesize
```

### Run
```bash
./filesize path/to/directory
```
